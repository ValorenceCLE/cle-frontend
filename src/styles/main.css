/* PrimeVue's base styles:
   (PrimeVue v4 styled mode generates component styles from the theme preset.
    If any global resets or core CSS are needed, import them here.
    In PrimeVue 4+, primevue.min.css is deprecated, so this may not be required.) */

/* Optionally, import additional CSS libraries or fonts here. 
   For example, PrimeFlex (if using utility classes from PrimeFaces), etc. 
   For a minimal setup, this section can remain empty. */
